  <summary>Colors</summary>
  The colors were chosen to fit with the science fiction theme with the yellow and orange being reminiscent of stars and the blue of the sky. The black background represents the emptiness of space. 
  <br>
All colors passed accessibility tests against the background color, 00040A. Some combinations such as the orange and yellow were never paired to adhere to accessibility considerations.

  <summary>Fonts</summary>
  Naxia, purchased from Type Factory, was chosen for use in the headers because of it’s distinctive flair. As straight lines are uncommon in the natural world, the straight, sharp ridgity of the font fits with the theme of man-made spaces common in science fiction. The aptly named space mono font, from Google Fonts, was chosen for the same reasons. Both fonts are legible, making them accessible to those with visual impairments and/or learning disabilities.

  <summary>Data breach</summary>
  At the beginning of the project, I made a mistake with the file structure. This resulted in issues deploying to Heroku, as I was working to fix this by testing migration and deployment, I accidentally forgot to put in the secret key into the Config vars in Heroku. This compromised the security of the data held within the database. This was rectified, so the current secret key is secure.
